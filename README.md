## HTML / CSS exercise for the UofT SCS Coding Bootcamp.

# Purpose
This particular challenge involved modifying an existing webpage such that it met established accessibility and SEO standards.

# HTML Modifications
The main index.html file was edited to include semantic elements which better describe the sequential flow of the webpage and its respective content partitionings, as well as to improve accessibility for those using screen-readers. Descriptive alt text was added to images on the page, and some broken hyperlinks were fixed. A proper title was added to the head element.

# CSS Modifications
The style.css file located in ./assets/css was modified to consolidate various stylings into reusable class and section declarations and includes some utility styling options as well. The main section stylings were also modified to behave more appropriately during window resizing in order to avoid overflowing and breaking elements.
